# GLGUI Toolbox

This is GLG's UI Engineers' toolbox of various scripts and tools. We will contribute to this as we have work that we think could help others in the community. Please don't hesitate to contact any of us contributors or the GLGUI account with questions, concerns or just general feedback. Thank you.

## Layout

We have the scripts in this base folder and examples in the... wait for it... examples folder.

## Utils

### Countdown.js
Counts down how many characters are left in a form field. This uses jQuery and jQuery's Widget Factory.

### String.pluralize
Determines singular or plural form of string passed in. Plural form can be overridden with an optional param.

### Date.toGenString
Stringifies a date object in the format '10/10/2010 21:15:07'
